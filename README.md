## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have:

1. **Node.js** (version 14 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **MySQL** (version 5.7 or higher) - [Download here](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)
3. **Git** (optional) - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Project
```bash
# If using Git
git clone <repository-url>
cd student-grade-management-system

# Or download and extract the ZIP file
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Set Up MySQL Database

1. **Start MySQL service** on your computer
2. **Create the database** using one of these methods:

   **Option A: Using MySQL Command Line**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   ```
   Then run the setup.sql file:
   ```sql
   source setup.sql
   ```

   **Option B: Using phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench**
   - Import the `setup.sql` file through the interface

### Step 4: Configure Database Connection

Edit `server.js` and update the database configuration:

```javascript
const dbConfig = {
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'your_mysql_username',    // Change this (default: 'root')
    password: 'your_mysql_password', // Change this
    database: 'student_management',
    // ... other settings
};
```

### Step 5: Start the Server
```bash
npm start
```

For development with auto-restart:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 6: Access the Application

Open your browser and go to:
- **Application**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:3000/api
